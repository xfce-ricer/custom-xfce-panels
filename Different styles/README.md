**PLEASE NOTE: I am Currently still making most of these .....**

**These panels hopefully inspire you to create something awesome that you can post on r/unixporn without feeling your panel is lacking something.**

Oh yes ! *Floating Buttons* in XFCE ..... 

I went for the simple yet functional approach here. Transperant panel background to give the plugin buttons their *FLoating* look. 

**Sneak Peak**
