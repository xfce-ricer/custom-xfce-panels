# Example Panels 

**PLEASE NOTE: I am Currently still making most of these .....**

**These panels hopefully inspire you to create something awesome that you can post on r/unixporn without feeling your panel is lacking something.**   

## 1. Floating Buttons 

Oh yes ! *Floating Buttons* in XFCE ..... 

I went for the simple yet functional approach here. Transperant panel background to give the plugin buttons their *FLoating* look. 

**Sneak Peak**

## 2. Arc x Nelio - FLoating Panel

This one is a personal favorite, A panel to compliment Arc theme using Nelio WM theme ([Nelio theme made by addy-dclxvi](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-theme-collections/blob/master/README.md))
