# custom-xfce-panels

*Currently a work in progress .....*

Will contain a few examples of different styles you can achieve, as well as a full guide on creating a custom XFCE Panel on a fresh install. 


**PLEASE NOTE
 - ALL EXAMPLE PANELS ARE INTENDED AS JUST THAT, EXAMPLES. THEY ARE PANELS I EDITED TO SUIT MY WORK FLOW THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS EASY TO INSTALL CUSTOM PANELS.I DO PROVIDE EVERYTHING REQUIRED FOR YOU TO LEARN HOW TO EDIT YOUR OWN PANEL

 - I have no prior knowledge of css and have written this after a few days of reasearch on creating a gtk.css file to customize the xfce panel. 
the guide contains some basic classes and more tips if you are keen to go further**
