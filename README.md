# custom-xfce-panels

*Currently a work in progress .....*

Will contain a few examples of different styles you can achieve, as well as a full guide on creating a custom XFCE Panel on a fresh install. 


**PLEASE NOTE**
 - **ALL EXAMPLE PANELS ARE INTENDED AS JUST THAT, EXAMPLES. THEY ARE PANELS I EDITED TO SUIT MY WORK FLOW THEY ARE NOT MEANT TO BE USED AS EASY TO INSTALL CUSTOM PANELS.I DO PROVIDE EVERYTHING REQUIRED FOR YOU TO LEARN HOW TO EDIT YOUR OWN PANEL**

 - **I have no prior knowledge of css and have written this after a few days of reasearch on creating a gtk.css file to customize the xfce panel. 
the guide contains some basic classes and more tips if you are keen to go further**

## What to start out with ?? 

1. Please finish reading this to the very end !!! 

2. I would highly suggest you start with the gtkcssfileguide.css. It contains a lot of helpful stuff if you are just starting out with customizing your Panel beyond th edefualt settings. 

3. Mess around with a fresh install of XFCE (whatever distro, for Linux noobs I highly recommend Linux Mint XFCE, ArcoLinux XFCE flagship editoin and Manjaro XFCE) customize the default panel a bit see, basically just get the hang of it.

4. See the "Differet Styles" folder. As the name suggests .... it contians a bunch of different panel styles. Each style will contain its own gtk.css and panel back-up as well as a detailed description of plugins etc... 

5. CREATE YOUR OWN TO MATCH YOUR WORK FLOW !!!!!
